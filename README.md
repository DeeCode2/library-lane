# Library Lane

Library Lane is a web application for finding independent bookstores in London and around the world.

Users can search for independent bookshops by borough and click on them to show more information such address and website links.

[Visit the live site](https://librarylane.netlify.app/).

## Technologies

Library Lane is built with **React**, **Vite**, and styled with **TailwindCSS**.

The data for each bookstores is stored and retrieved from a **Firestore** database.

Location data is displayed using **LeafletJS**.

## More Features

Soon I will be implementing more filter categories that would allow users to search for bookstores based on the facilities they offer (e.g. coworking spaces, cafes, dog-friendly etc.)
